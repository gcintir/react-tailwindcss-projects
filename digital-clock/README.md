# React + Tailwind CSS Digital Clock Project

This is a simple and responsive digital clock application built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. The app displays the current time and date, with support for toggling between 12-hour and 24-hour formats. It also includes a dark mode feature for better user experience.

## Features

- **Real-Time Clock**: Displays the current time (hours, minutes, and seconds) and updates every second.
- **Date Display**: Shows the current day, month, and year.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes.
- **Hour Format Toggle**: Switch between 12-hour and 24-hour time formats.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive and works on all screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application.
- **Vite**: For fast development and build tooling.
